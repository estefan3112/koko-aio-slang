/* There yoy have a chance to boost your FPS.
 * 
 * The more lines you edit, the more your FPS will be high.
 * 
 * Edit lines that way, eg:
 * 
 * 	#define SCANLINE_DARK	params.SCANLINE_DARK
 * 	turns to:
 * 	#define SCANLINE_DARK	0.2
 * 
 * or:
 * 	#define DO_CCORRECTION	global.DO_CCORRECTION
 * 	turns to
 * 	#define DO_CCORRECTION	0.0
 *
 * 
 * Since everything after "//" is ignored,
 * you can even do something like:
 * 	#define DO_CCORRECTION	0.0 //global.DO_CCORRECTION
 * 
 * 
 * ...that's it, you just need to copy the values from the
 * preset you like to the right setting here.
 * 
 * The downside of using this method is that every setting
 * you turn, will be static and you will not be able to
 * modify it "on-the-fly" in retroarch.
 * 
 * The only way to change that values will be to edit this file
 * again, so maybe doing multiple copies of this file
 * or even of the whole koko-shader would be a good idea.
 * 
 * 
 * I suggest you to start from the easy ones, the ones that
 * starts with DO_****, like DO_SCANLINES.
 * it takes a value = 0 or 1, where 0 means no, 1 means yes.
 * I repeat: if you always wants scanlines, just use:
 * 
 * 	#define DO_SCANLINES		1.0
 * 	instead of
 * 	#define #DO_SCANLINES	global.DO_SCANLINES
 * 
 * 
 * Also, take a copy of this (modified) file, because it would be overwritten by
 * updates.
 *
