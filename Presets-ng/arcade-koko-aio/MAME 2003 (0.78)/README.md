# Installing Presets in MAME 2003

In order to automagically use these presets, place them into the RetroArch support folder ../config/MAME 2003 (0.78). This guarantees that whenever you start a game with this filename, the shader activates. 

Note that the additional Artwork must be installed according to the instructions there.<br>
