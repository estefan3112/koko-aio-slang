# Installing Presets in FinalBurn Neo

In order to automagically use these presets, place them into the RetroArch support folder ../config/FinalBurn Neo. This guarantees that whenever you start a game with this filename, the shader activates. 

The FinalBurn Neo.cfg file contains only one line and shall guarantee that the Aspect Ratio is set to 'Full'. Without this setting, the Artwork will not appear.

Note that the additional Artwork must be installed according to the instructions there.<br>
