# Installing Arcade Presets in FinalBurn Neo and/or MAME(current), MAME 2003 or MAME 2003plus

In order to automagically use these presets, place them into the RetroArch support folder "../config/FinalBurn Neo" and/or "../config/MAME" and/or "../config/MAME 2003 (078)" and/or "../config/MAME 2003-Plus". This guarantees that whenever you start a game with this filename and the respective core, the shader activates.

The core-specific folders now contain all presets that work in that core. A lot of work, but worth it.

Games with backdrops typically work only in MAME variants, but not FinalBurn Neo.

Note: The FinalBurn Neo.cfg, MAME 2003 (078).cfg and MAME 2003-Plus.cfg files contain only one line and shall guarantee that the Aspect Ratio is set to 'Full'. Without this setting, the Artwork will not appear.

Also note that the additional Artwork must be installed according to the instructions there.<br>
