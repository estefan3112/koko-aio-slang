# Installing the 4K Arcade Artwork in RetroArch

4K textures are provided separately only because of their file size.

Please move these textures into the same folder as the other artwork - 'arcade_textures', which must always be in ../shaders/shaders_slang/bezel/koko-aio/textures/.
You also need to have the game-specific arcade presets installed in accordance with the instructions there.<br>
