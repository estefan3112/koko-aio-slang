# Installing the Arcade Artwork with Backdrops in RetroArch (manual install)

The entire folder named 'backdrop_textures' must always be in ../shaders/shaders_slang/bezel/koko-aio-backdrops/textures/.
You also need to have the game-specific arcade backdrop presets installed in accordance with the instructions there. <br>

Finally: You need to manually edit the config.inc file in the shaders subdirectory by uncommenting backdrop support in line #56. 

I plan to issue a separate backdrops package in the near future.<br>
